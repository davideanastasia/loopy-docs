# Notes

This is the first version of the PCB: only 5 have been made and they have long gone, so you can skip these documents unless you have one of these PCBs.

## Errata 

- As clear from the schematic, there is an error in the routing of the relays, so cuts were necessary on this version of the PCB to make it fully functional (I have uploaded the unmodified schematic to show where the problem is).
- wrong footprint for 7805 (package is TO220, but pinout is TO92): to solve, mount on the bottom side of the PCB
- (not mandatory) connect 5V+ to PIN 20 of U1

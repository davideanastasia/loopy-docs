##  FAQ

### Where can I find a PCB?

Please contact me if you need a PCB: I will try to have spares available as long as there is demand for it.

### Why no display?

Rectangular holes (of good quality) are generally quite hard to make unless you have specialised tools, so I have put more effort on dislaying the status using LEDs, which only require round holes.

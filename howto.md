# How To Build Loopy

# Relays

Loopy uses miniaturised signal relays. Some of the possible options are:

- Zettler AZ850-5
- NEC EA2-5NU
- Fujitsu A-5W-K
- Panasonic/NAIS TQ2-5V

Some of these models are discontinued, but any other signal relay with the same pinout will work just fine. I have uploaded a few datasheets for consultation in the `datasheets` folder.

The interface hinges around 5 footswitches and 18 LED.

The 2 LED on the right side will indicate the status, while the other 16 will indicate which feature is ON.

8 LED of the bottom strip will indicate whether a loop is engaged or not, while the 8 LED of the top strip will indicate bank & preset.

In play mode, every loop can be directly accessed either pushing one footswitch, or two footswitch at the same time. The entire looper can be bypassed using the `BP` footswitch:
